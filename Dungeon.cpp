    //This needs to construct all the levels, then
    //the function has to mix the first 14 levels in a random order, that have to contain 9 enemies, 3 chests and 2 shops
    //15th level has to be decided, 16 is the boss
    //PreEventInterface has to be in the array of events or not? Maybe each event has his subfunction that does this
